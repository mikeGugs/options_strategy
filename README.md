# Options Project
This is a personal project to build an automated system for exploring options trading opportunities from S&P 500 stocks.

The basic idea is to compare implied volatilities to realized volatilites. Then, based on any major discrepencies, explore building potential options positions (e.g. straddles, strangles, call spreads, put spreads, directional bets, etc).

This project is very much a work in progress.
